##Course description

*2 Class Hours, 4 Lab Hours, 4 Credit Hours*

Students will learn the use of server-side scripting to create dynamic, database driven sites using PHP and MySQL. Emphasis is placed on applications that are user-friendly and secure.

##Prerequisites

SE 111 (*HTML and JavaScript*) 

SE 133 (*Database Management*)

##Required textbook

Students are recommend to use **E-Books from Books 24x7** which is a service offered to all students.

The following book is available on Books 24x7

**PHP Quick Scripting Reference** by Mikael Olsson.

Publisher: Apress © 2013 (140 pages).

ISBN: 9781430262831


Please respect copyright and purchase the book. Doing anything less is stealing.

##Recommended supplies:

A flash drive, notebook computer, or web service on which you can back up your work frequently.  **A portable hard drive would be a better choice and is highly recommended.**

**A github.com account is required.** You can sign up at https://education.github.com/pack  for a free private account.  Please use the first letter of your first name and your last name for the account if possible. Gabriel Forti would be gforti.  **All assignments must be posted on your github.com account before you submit the url to your account.**

##Course Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this class, students will be able to: 

	* Create dynamic web pages using PHP. This will be evidenced by completion of lab and homework assignments, quizzes, and exams.

	*Use PHP to process information submitted via HTML forms. The student will provide evidence of acquisition of this skill using laboratory exercises, and out of class exercises in developing user interfaces for their projects as well as in quiz and exam questions.

	*Connect PHP scripts to a MySQL database for long-term data storage and retrieval as evidenced by completion of lab and homework assignments, quizzes, and exams.

	*Use a variety of PHP features to solve programming problems typically encountered in web development. This will be evidenced by completion of lab and homework assignments, quizzes, and exams.

	*Describe how security limitations can impact program development as evidenced by completion of lab and homework assignments, quizzes, and exams.

	*Break down complex programs using MVC for more productive development. The student will provide evidence of acquisition of this skill using laboratory exercises, and out of class exercises in developing user interfaces for their projects as well as in quiz and exam questions.

##Assessment Measures 

A midterm and a comprehensive final examination will be used to assess the student’s ability to list, describe compare, recognize and identify appropriate concepts, tools and procedures described in the course objectives. Scores of 60% or higher for all exams are expected to be achieved.

Laboratory exercises will be used to reinforce, demonstrate and practice concepts and procedures described in the course objectives. A minimum of 90% of all assigned lab activities are expected to be completed to the satisfaction of the instructor. Scores of 60% or higher for all laboratory exercises are expected to be achieved.

Project assignments will be used to assess the student’s ability to independently design and implement solutions to programming challenges.

##Evaluation and Grading Criteria

The final grade will be based on the instructor’s evaluation of how well the student has mastered the course objectives. The evaluation will be based primarily on a composite of the student’s performance on quizzes, homework, labs, and the final exam. Weighting of the major criteria is as follows:

	+ Assignments ........................................70%
	+ Lab Participation..................................05%
	+ In-class Project.....................................10%
	+ Final Examination................................15%

##Attendance and Tardiness

Your on-time arrival is appreciated and expected.

Lectures are started at the beginning of class.

##Late work and make-ups

Each assignment turned after its due date will have its grade reduced by 5% per day. Accommodation for ***unusual*** life events may be made if you contact me via email at least one day before the assignment is due.

***Final deadline:*** No work or exam can be turned in after the conclusion of the final class period.

Where NEIT policy indicates otherwise, NEIT policies will of course be followed.

##Lab time is critical

Since labs are assigned at the beginning of class and due at the end of class, much of the learning that will occur throughout this course will happen during lab time.

**Please do not leave lab unless you have completed the current assignment and verified that it is correctly submitted to Canvas.**

##The student is expected to

	* Attend all scheduled lectures and labs, arriving on time.

	* Check Canvas (neit.instructure.com) on a regular basis for class announcements, additional notes, and assignments.

	* Keep abreast of what is covered in class if an absence occurs, including material delivered verbally in class that may not be included in printed documents.

	* Be respectful to other students and the instructor in the classroom. This includes not talking while lecture or instructions are being given as well as refraining from using offensive language.

	* Work together to find solutions. Although I will not accept code that has been copied directly from another student, I encourage students to work together during lab time. Programming is often best accomplished in collaboration.

##Preliminary course outline

This schedule is a work-in-progress and is subject to change on account of student needs, weather, etc. Visit Canvas frequently for announcements and updates. Lab assignment requirements will be detailed in separate documents.

Please at least skim through Canvas Course Documents and Announcements for each week before class. Doing so will help it make sense in the limited time we have to talk about the topics before getting down to work.

 

**The design of this course as outlined in the syllabus requires you to do work outside of class to be successful.**
